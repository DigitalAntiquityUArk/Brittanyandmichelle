								<h2>History of Gabii</h2>
							</header>

							<p>One of the biggest debates in archeology right now is exactly how and when urban centers emerged in central Italy. The arguments are based on excavations done in many of Italy’s well known cities such as Rome, Tarquinia, and Naples. In the summer of 2009, it became apparent that another ancient city, Gabii, could hold the answers to this debate. Gabii is located approximately 12 miles east of Rome and is thought to have been founded during the Early Iron Age (900-700 BCE). Its location allowed it to have direct dealing with Rome, due to the fact that it was at the intersection of important interregional roadways. This meant that the two cities had many interactions and similarities. Gabii is the perfect site to gain a better understanding of Rome and life in Ancient Italy due to its closeness with Rome and the fact that it is well preserved on government land. There are many historical references that suggest that Gabii was important for the expansion of the Roman Republic. Despite its ties with Rome, the city was abandoned in the late Imperial period. This abandonment yielded the well preserved artifacts that are being examined today. Most notable at Gabii is the fact that the city has a very formal layout.  The entire layout is focused on a road that runs from Gabii to Rome, in an orthogonal city plan that dictates the placement of most of the buildings around it. This suggests extreme urbanization of the city and may have been the basis for the organization of Rome. Another important fact gained from the excavation is that the city was home to many wealthy families and gives some insight into burial practices of the times. This city provides evidence for many time periods as well, due to the fact that the city was constructed in stages.</p>

								<h2>Area B</h2>
							</header>

							<p>Area B represents some of the later development of the city with artifacts such as pottery and roads suggesting its development at around the Republican period (5th -6th century BCE). This area has been hypothesized to have been developed after Area D was abandoned. It is obvious in this area that the time periods are different due to the more rigid and centralized layout of the house that encompasses most of area B. A house of this size and with a paved courtyard as its center suggest a family belonging to the wealthy class. This house was abandoned and the site was a small necropolis towards the end of the 1st century BCE. This necropolis is composed of both adult and subadult inhumation ranging from elaborate tombs of tile capped with brick while others are simple holes in the ground. The goal of this project was to examine compare tombs from two different areas to try and gain an understanding of how and why Gabii was suddenly abandoned. It was also hoped that we could gain some insight into how people lived during this time. The first tomb we examined was tomb 5 in Area B. This tomb held an individual of a level greater than a slave but not the wealthiest in the area due to the fact that tiles lined the bottom of the grave but no extravagant artifacts were in the grave. This combined with the fact that body had badly damaged ribs and was missing his lower legs and feet suggest he or she may have been an agricultural worker or a soldier. The fact that a once richly inhabited area was turned into a cemetery means that Gabii was on the downhill slide and also could mean that Italy was facing a health crisis.</p>

								<h2>Area D</h2>
							</header>

							<p>Area D was thriving during the late seventh and sixth century BCE. Unlike Area B, this site was filled with impasto pottery, large storage vessels and bucchero which suggest that the building belonged to the elite class. The class of the area was reduced when the area was also turned into burial grounds towards the end of the sixth century. These tombs are much different from Area B due to the fact that they are cut out shafts with niches that house a stone bed for the body. The tombs were then closed off by wooden planks. To explore this area, tomb 39 was chosen for its location in one of the more extravagant niches and based on how well preserved it was. The importance of the body in this tomb is supported by the fact that the body was not only placed on a stone bed overlaid with organic planks and covered from the elements but it was placed on a pillow. The fact that the tombs were allowed to buried in the city suggest the elite class as well. Normally, no one was allowed to be buried in the city except for young infants who had not yet cut teeth because they were not yet considered part of the city. What can be concluded from both of these burials is that the type and extravagance of a burial demonstrates the person’s social standings.  That the level of extravagates for tombs decreased by the time Area B was made a necropolis suggest that people were dying at faster rates than before and there was either not the time to make the cut out tombs or people did not place the same amount of value on these elaborate death beds. This goes on to support the idea that the health of Gabii was deteriorating whether it be by war or sickness is unknown.</p>
